Boltzmann Machine Recommender System
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This is a recommender system built based on the theory of "Restricted Boltzmann Machines". This system is built from scratch, the layers,
the nodes and the functionality are manually coded. There are available libraries which someone can use to replicate a RBM though. For the 
training of our RBM we use 100,000 ratings, but in the "data" folder a set with 1,000,000 ratings is also provides in case someone wants to
achieve better results. 

Some general info about the code and the functionality:

o	Predicts a binary outcome, if the customer will like (yes or no) the product (movie)
o	Used dataset MovieLens with 100,000 ratings and 1,700 movies
o	Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) from scratch based on the paper posted as a PDF
o	Contains a class which applies the k-step contrastive divergence technique in order to approximate and maximize likelihood 
o	Used gibbs sampling to estimate the gradience of the likelihood. 
o	Inputs: ratings of the movies by the different users, users are the observations who are fed in the rbm one by one
o	Users are put as the lines and movies as the columns
o	Converted the data into torch sensors
o	Converted the ratings (0-5) into binary ratings 1 (Liked) or 0 (Not Liked)
o	Calculate the weights and update them between each pass from hidden to visible nodes and back
